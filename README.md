# Microservices E-Commerce App

This project is a **Microservices-based E-Commerce Application** built with **Spring Cloud**, **Spring Boot**, and **Spring AI**. It demonstrates how modern distributed systems can power scalable and intelligent e-commerce platforms.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Spring Boot** â€“ Core microservices framework
- **Spring Cloud** â€“ Service discovery, API Gateway, configuration management
- **Spring AI** â€“ Generative AI integration for enhanced user experiences (e.g., product recommendations, smart search, AI-driven descriptions)
- **RabbitMQ** â€“ Message broker for asynchronous communication and event-driven architecture
- **REST APIs** â€“ Clean and well-structured endpoints for e-commerce workflows

## âœ¨ Features
- Modular microservices architecture for scalability
- API Gateway & centralized configuration using Spring Cloud
- Event-driven communication with RabbitMQ
- Integration of Generative AI to enhance the shopping experience
- Example APIs for products, orders, payments, and user management

## ðŸš€ Goals
This repository is designed as a **learning project** and a **portfolio showcase**.  
It demonstrates not only how to build a production-ready microservices e-commerce system, but also how to integrate **GenAI capabilities** into a modern Spring ecosystem.
