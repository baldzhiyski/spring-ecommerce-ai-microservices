With JSpecify and NullAway, Java developers can finally bring null safety into their workflow—catching potential NullPointerExceptions at compile time and making the absence of a value part of the type system. In this talk, you will learn how JSpecify works, how to use it with NullAway, and how it helps turn null from hazard to feature.

      "description": "AI is all over the news. Yet, what powers the systems that provide the models and information, and allows access to the AI solutions? For many organizations, the answer is Spring. As the backbone of countless Java enterprise applications, Spring enables the development of robust, testable, and scalable solutions. So, what exactly is Spring and why is it so widely adopted for both AI-driven and traditional systems?\n\nIn this session, we will discuss Spring and explore its core principles: simplicity, dependency injection, IOC, and convention over configuration. From Spring Boot's rapid development to integrating AI with Spring AI, this talk provides a high-level, yet practical, overview of the Spring ecosystem. Whether you are new, coming from another tech stack, or simply curious, you will walk away with a clear understanding of Spring.",
